# Contributing to go-librespot

There just a few guidelines to follow when contributing to this project. Please take a moment to read them:

* Try to split your changes into separate, atomic commits that each make one change. This makes it easier to review and
  understand the changes.
* Use [conventional commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/): the first line of the commit
  message should be the intent followed by a short description of the change (e.g. `feat: added x`), and the body
  should provide more detail, if appropriate.
* Follow Golang conventions for naming, formatting, and structuring code. Use `gofmt` to format your code.
* If you're adding a new feature, please consider opening an issue first to discuss it. This can save you time if the
  feature is not something that can be merged into the project.
